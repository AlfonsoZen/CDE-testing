Welcome to the Automated Testing repository, where we explore and document the use of Jest and Cypress for automated testing in web projects.

## Project Information - Claro Drive Enterprise (DCE)

The project built based on this research is called Claro Drive Enterprise, and the repository is named "DCE-testing." The mission of this investigation is to decide which frameworks we will use for the project. The options under consideration are:
